# FizzBuzz Detector

## 🚀 About the Project
FizzBuzz Detector is a C# application that processes a given input string according to FizzBuzz rules. The algorithm replaces:
- Every **third** word with `"Fizz"`.
- Every **fifth** word with `"Buzz"`.
- Words that are both **third and fifth** with `"FizzBuzz"`.
- Only **alphanumeric words** are counted (special characters and spaces are ignored).

This project includes a **FizzBuzzDetector class** with a method `GetOverlappings()`, which returns a processed string and the number of replacements.
